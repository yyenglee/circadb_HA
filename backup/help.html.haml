    Welcome to the CIRCA help page. Here you will find all the information
    you need for a successful search.

    %a(name="querying"){:style => "color:#111;"} Querying CircaDB
  %p
    There are three modes of querying CircaDB:
    By gene symbol,
    %a(href="#simple") Simple
    and
    %a(href="#advanced") Advanced.
    In all three modes using the wildcard character "*" is possible.
  %h3
    %a(name="simple"){:style => "color:#111;"} Simple Query Mode
  %p
    This is the default. Simply enter a set of terms and the engine will query for
    each term separately, then join all of the results from each separate term together
    into the final result. In other words a query for <code>kinase inhibitor</code>
    will return all entries with the word <code>kinase</code> together with any entry
    that has <code>inhibitor</code> in their respective annotations.
  %p
    This is usually not what one would want returned from such a query. This is where
    the advanced query mode comes in.

  %h3
    %a(name="advanced"){:style => "color:#111;"} Advanced Query Mode
  %p
    Once the "advanced query mode" check-box has been selected, the query strings
    are no longer simply split into individual queries. As the saying goes "with
    great power comes great responsibility". In a nutshell, you must now use the
    underlying Sphinx search engine's
    %a(href="http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/2.0.5/extended-syntax.html") extended syntax query mode.


  %p
    Briefly, the default behavior of the query <code>kinase inhibitor</code> would bring
    back all entries that match both <code>kinase <b> AND </b> inhibitor</code>.
    Instead of an implicit <code>OR</code> between terms, there is now an implicit
    <code>AND</code> between terms.
  %p
    To bring back the <code>OR</code> behavior you would need to separate terms
    with a <code>|</code> (a vertical bar, or "pipe") character. E.g.
    <code> kinase | inhibitor</code>.
  %p
    To bring back the specific phrase "kinase inhibitor", you would need to
    surround both words with quotes. E.g. <code>"kinase inhibitor"</code>
  %h4 More examples
  %p
    %em Query for the exact phrase "kinase inhibitor" that also make mention of "mitochondrial"
    %br
    %code "kinase inhibitor" mitochondrial
  %p
    %em Query for kinases, but not any entry with "inhibitor" in the record
    %br
    %code kinase !inhibitor

  %h4 Even more examples
  %p
    Sphinx is a large a powerful system. You can review all of the various
    ways to use the extended syntax at the

  %h4 CircaDB Query Fields
  %p
    Having read the above, you may be wondering what fields you can use to query CircaDB. The annotation is straight from the Affymetrix annotation files. We have pulled out certain columns from that file and indexed them as follows:

  %table
    %tr
      %th Field
      %th Description
    %tr
      %td probeset_name
      %td The Affymetrix probeset name
    %tr
      %td transcript_id
      %td The transcript ID
    %tr
      %td representative_public_id
      %td
    %tr
      %td unigene_id
      %td Unigene ID
    %tr
      %td gene_symbol
      %td NCBI gene symbol
    %tr
      %td gene_title
      %td Full gene title
    %tr
      %td entrez_gene
      %td The Entrez gene ID
    %tr
      %td swissprot
      %td The SwisProt accession
    %tr
      %td refseq_protein_id
      %td The RefSeq protein accession
    %tr
      %td refseq_transcript_id
      %td The RefSeq NA sequence accession
    %tr
      %td target_description
      %td The description from the Affymetrix annotation file
  %h3
    %a(name="probability"){:style => "color:#111;"} Probability filter
  %p
    The probability filter can be used to narrow the output to the most significant results. The database can be filtered for
    %a(href="#p-value") p-values
    and
    %a(href="#p-value") q-values
    produced by the different algorithms. The given value is used as the upper cutoff.
  %h3
    %a(name="phase_range"){:style => "color:#111;"} Phase range
  %p
    The here specified range can be used to filter for genes that share the same
    %a(href="#range") phase.
    Only the phases computed by JTK are considered during this filter step.
  %h2
    %a(name="results"){:style => "color:#111;"} Understanding the results
  %p
    There are three different algorithms to statistically test if a dataset
    is cyclic or not. More information about these algorithms can be found
    in the #{link_to("About", about_path())} tab.
  %p
    %b Note:
    %i For all the algorithms we tested cyclic behavior for a range of different periods, except for the DeLichtenberg were we only looked for a period of 24 hours.
  %h3
    %a(name="plot"){:style => "color:#111;"} Plots
  %p
    As result we will see a plot, where the X-axis is the time in
    hours and the Y-axis reflects the expression levels measured
    on the individual gene chips. The background shaded areas represent the cycle of light and dark conditions based on CT times.
  =image_tag("plot.png", :alt=> "PLOT")
  %h3
    %a(name="p-value"){:style => "color:#111;"} p-Value
  %p
    This statistical size, is the estimated probability of rejecting the null hypothesis. Here the null hypothesis is a dataset not being cyclic. The lower the p-value the more significant is the test result.
  %h3
    %a(name="q-value"){:style => "color:#111;"} q-Value
  %p
    The q-value of a test is the minimum false discovery rate at which a gene is mistakenly called cyclic.
  %h3
    %a(name="period"){:style => "color:#111;"} Period
  %p
    This value gives information on how often the cycle is repeated. Is the period
    %i 24
    , the pattern reoccurs every 24 hours.
  %h3
    %a(name="phase"){:style => "color:#111;"} Phase
  %p
    The phase reflects the timing in the individual tissues. The DeLichtenberg algorithm does not provide this value in its output.
  %h2
    %a(name="faq"){:style => "color:#111;"} Frequently asked questions
  %table

      %th How do I select more than one experiment?
      %td "Ctrl+Right Click" lets you select multiple experiments ("Command+Right Click" for mac users)
    %tr
      %th How do I request a data set be added to CircaDB?
      %td
        Researchers can request that a particular data set be added by submitting an issue at our project page hosted at
        %a(href="https://github.com/itmat/circadb/issues") Github.
